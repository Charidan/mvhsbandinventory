= Introduction =

Since the file store path is going to vary significantly between users of the application on Mac OS X-based computers, Linux-based computers, and Windows-based computers, it makes sense to store the path in a separate configuration file.  Since we'd be constantly overwriting each others' configuration settings if the configuration file was stored in the source repository, you have to create the configuration file yourself.

= Creating the Config File =

In !NetBeans, right click the `mvhsbandinventory` package in the `Source Packages` directory in the `MVHSBandInventory` project.  Select `New` -> `Other...` in the context menu.  A window will appear with a set of categories and choices in those categories.  In the `Other` category of that window, select `Properties File` and click `Next >`.  Name the file `app` and click `Finish`.  Open up the `app.properties` file for editing and insert the appropriate file store path configuration information.  Examples for each major platform are as follows.
