This is an Eagle Scout Project done for the music department of Mountain View High School.

This program provides a database of all school-owned instruments, their accessories (mouthpieces, straps, etc.), and the student (if any) they are currently rented out to.

The program is additionally capable of generating a filled-out PDF contract based on an instrument and student to be printed and signed.
