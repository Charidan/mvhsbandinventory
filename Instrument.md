# Introduction #

Each instantiation of this class represents a physical instrument and all of the attributes thereof. The [InstrumentList](InstrumentList.md) can utilize the information held in the Instrument object to save to a file, and later create an Instrument based on the saved file.

# Details #

This class, representing each instrument, is responsible for holding all the attributes of the instrument in one place.

These attributes include: name, brand, serial # (String), rank (int), value (int), status, notes, history, ligature, mouthpiece, mouthpiece cap, and bow.

The constructor takes all the attributes initially provided and stores them as private variables. The Instrumentâ€™s methods revolve around returning and changing these attributes (getSerialNumber, setSerialNumber, etc.). The other extremely important method in this class is the makeContract({name of student}), which creates the contract for the student to verify and sign in order to loan out the instrument (see sample contract for more detail).
